## Howdy 👋

Just a dude that likes to make computers do things. Memory and low level code gets me hot and bothered. Aspiring graphics programmer. I'm in an abusive relationship with C++, please help.

I'm currently actively maintaining two projects:

### [Xen](https://github.com/XenLanguage/Xen) - v0.5.4

Xen is a loosely-typed, imperative scripting language written in C. 

### [clic](https://github.com/jakerieger/clic) - v0.1.0

clic is a header-only library for building CLI applications in C.
